# Kay-Macropad
### Inspiration
I wanted to create a macropad that allowed me to enter in data when I am doing schoolwork. I created a macropad using 10 switches and 1 rp2040.

### Challenges
One thing that was really hard for me was to do was designing the PCB. This was my first time doing it and it took me a long time.

### Specifications
BOM: 
- 10x Cherry MX Switches
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 10x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x M3 Heatset

Overall Hackpad
